       ## Flow of Execution

 *Incoming Request:
When a request comes to the server, it first hits the auth middleware.
auth performs its checks and calls next().

*Next Middleware:
The request then moves to the logger middleware.
logger performs its logging and calls next().

*Final Route Handler:
After all middleware functions are executed, the request reaches the route handler for the / route.
The route handler sends the response "Hello, world!" to the client.

*conclusion:
Without calling next(), the request would be stuck in the current middleware and never reach the final route handler or any subsequent middleware functions.
            
request received via app.use(---);
Logger Middleware: Logs the request details.
Auth Middleware: Checks if the user is authenticated.
Route Handler: Sends the final response.*/}

  cookies contains jwt secret key,user details also all data in form of jwt(json type format not decrypt easily)
  How it Works
Client Logs In: When a user logs into your application, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client.
Storing the JWT: The client stores this JWT in a cookie.
Sending Requests: For every subsequent request to the server, the client's browser automatically includes this cookie.
Authenticating Requests: The server reads the JWT from the cookie to verify the user's identity. 

example:
     Login:

           User sends login credentials (username and password) to the server.
           Server verifies credentials, creates a JWT, and sends it back in a response.
           Client stores the JWT in a cookie.

    Authenticated Request:

            Client makes a request to a protected route.
            Browser includes the JWT cookie in the request.
            Server middleware (like your auth function) reads the JWT from the cookie, verifies it, and determines the userâ€™s identity.
            
            head to next middleware*/}
